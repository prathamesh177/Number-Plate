## Features

- **Real-Time Number Plate Detection**: Detect number plates from video feeds or images.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extract alphanumeric characters from detected plates.
- **High Accuracy**: Robust detection in various lighting and environmental conditions.
- **Scalability**: Supports batch processing of multiple images.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverages pre-trained deep learning models for efficient detection.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: 
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning
  - OpenCV for image processing
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract OCR

## Usage

### Running Locally
1. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Access the application:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

### Using Pre-trained Model
- Download the pre-trained weights from YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 and place them in the `models/` directory.
