# Number Plate Detection

A computer vision project to detect and recognize number plates from vehicle images or videos using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This project is built to assist in automated parking systems, law enforcement, and vehicle tracking applications.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Number Plate Detection**: Detect number plates from video feeds or images.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extract alphanumeric characters from detected plates.
- **High Accuracy**: Robust detection in various lighting and environmental conditions.
- **Scalability**: Supports batch processing of multiple images.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverages pre-trained deep learning models for efficient detection.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: 
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning
  - OpenCV for image processing
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract OCR
- **Dataset**: Public datasets like Open Images Dataset or custom-labeled data
- **Deployment**:
  - Flask / FastAPI for creating REST APIs
  - Docker for containerization

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-plate-detection.git
   cd number-plate-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install Tesseract OCR:
   - For Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
     ```
   - For Windows:
     Download and install from [Tesseract OCR GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

## Usage

### Running Locally
1. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Access the application:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

### Using Pre-trained Model
- Download the pre-trained weights from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/your-link) and place them in the `models/` directory.

### Testing with Images
- Add your test images to the `test_images/` directory.
- Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --image test_images/car.jpg
   ```
